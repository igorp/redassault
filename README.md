Red Assault is a 2D turn-based strategy game set during the Cold War that I'm currently working on.
The player builds up an army consisting of tanks, infantry and air units after which he goes to battle against the opposing commander.
The version viewable here is an old one, written in Java using the LWJGL game library.
I have since decided to switch to C++ for performance and cross-platform related reasons.

Note that the images files are not included as the plan is to eventually release a fully complete game.
However, all of the programming code should be there.

Here's a link to the game's official website: https://redassault.net/
